Language bounds individuals together just as much as it divides them. Upon reading the
last sentence, one may first think of interlanguage boundaries as the ones we have seen
in the previous chapter: if two individuals cannot understand each other's language,
communication is effectively very limited. This chapter, on the other hand, is dedicated
to intra-language differences: when people speak the same language, but differently,
which is also a strong marker of social divides. As we already emphasized in
\cref{ch:origins_lang_diversity}, language variation in a population is driven by many
factors, among which the socio-economic background of individuals is essential. And as
we also said previously, one's ability to use the standard form of their language can be
associated to a higher linguistic capital, and has thus economic value. It is not
uncommon that some classes of the population, particularly those of relatively low
\ac{SES}, prefer to use the non-standard form. This has been shown by some
sociolinguists in the past, as they conducted field studies and analysed differences
between socio-economic classes
\cite{LabovSocialStratification1966,TrudgillSocialDifferentiation1974}. As groups of
lower \ac{SES} have less linguistic capital, their economic opportunities will also be
affected. \Ac{SES} and this linguistic variation are thus mutually sustaining: one
inherits a \ac{SES} along which comes a linguistic capital that contributes --- among
other things --- to constrain them to their status of origin. Understanding the
mechanisms that lead to this linguistic segregation is therefore of great importance.
Although this phenomenon has long been known \cite{ChambersSociolinguisticTheory2007},
it has been observed on very limited scales, and, more importantly, no model explaining
how it might emerge has been proposed. These are the two shortcomings we wish to address
in this chapter. 

First, as we have already shown in previous chapters, a first step toward understanding
is to measure the phenomenon. It has already been quantified by the PISA reports of the
OECD \cite{OECDWhereAll2019}, which consistently show that students with lower
socio-economic background tend to have a lower reading proficiency. While these confirm
there is an issue to tackle, they are not extensive enough. They do not test language
production, and not the whole population but only a sample of students of a specific
age. Alternative empirical works are thus needed. Data from social media have repeatedly
proven useful to link \ac{SES} and different social behaviours
\cite{GaoComputationalSocioeconomics2019}. In particular, Twitter data were used in the
past to study geographical variation of linguistic variables
\cite{EisensteinDiffusionLexical2014}. Closer to our topic of interest still, some past
work has investigated the dependence on \ac{SES} of the frequency of a few markers of
non-standard language in France, as seen on Twitter
\cite{AbitbolSocioeconomicDependencies2018}, showing the potential of this data source
for such an analysis. Here,\graffito{Almost all data analyses, simulations and plots
were made using Python code, freely available on GitHub \cite{LoufSesling2023}.} we
investigate these dependencies in England and Wales, by way of measuring how Twitter
users abide by the rules of the standard variety of their language.


% \cite{LaksWhyThere2013} In such a conception, communication is a leading force in the emergence and stabilization of human linguistic competence, both diachronically and synchronically. In this approach, variation and heterogeneity are to be seen as core factors in shaping language. Thus, as argued some 50 years ago by Weinreich, variation and heterogeneity are to be regarded as structurally functional, and as fundamental dimensions of language.
% \cite{KinzlerNativeLanguage2007} social groups are partly built and opposed based on language, and very early

\section{An influence of socio-economic status?}

\subsection{Twitter data analysis}
To do so, we analyse the tweets written in English by users identified as UK residents,
following the methodology described in \cref{sec:methods_twitter}. To assign a \ac{SES}
to these users, we also determine their area of residence from the geotags attached to
their tweets. Our unit areas for the study are the \SI{7201}{} \acp{MSOA}, which are
areas created by the Office for National Statistics of the UK for the output of the
census estimates\footnote{Their boundaries can be downloaded from the Open Geography
portal of the Office for National Statistics:
\url{https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/maps/msoa-dec-2011-boundaries-generalised-clipped-bgc-ew-v3}}.
They host at least \SI{5000}{} and at most \SI{15000}{} inhabitants, with a typical
population of \SI{10000}{}. Importantly, the average annual net income of their
residents can be obtained from the census\footnote{In particular the 2018 net annual
income estimates, available at
\url{https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/smallareaincomeestimatesformiddlelayersuperoutputareasenglandandwales}},
which gives us a proxy for the \ac{SES} of our Twitter users.

The second ingredient we need for our analysis is their propensity to deviate from the
rules defining standard English. The solution we picked to measure these deviations is
LanguageTool, an open-source grammar, style and spell checker. The first advantage of
using such a tool over a pre-defined set of rules, as in
\cite{AbitbolSocioeconomicDependencies2018}, is that the tool is implemented in 15
languages. Our study can thus quite easily be replicated in other countries. The second
advantage is that it covers a very wide spectrum of potential mistakes: it has more than
\SI{5500}{} rules defined for the English language. These rules are split into 11
categories, among which are grammar mistakes, confused words or typos. In this work we
focus on grammar mistakes, as they are among the most common and are the most
characteristic of non-standard language. LanguageTool therefore enables us to compute
the frequency at which Twitter users identified as UK residents make grammar mistakes
according to standard rules. From this raw frequency we then compute the frequency of
mistakes per word written by the user. As in the previous chapter, we compute this
frequency on a user level, to try and be more representative of the general population,
and not only of the few, very active users. At the cell level, we compute the average of
these relative frequencies for all residents. This implies that we cannot keep all
users, as some have been so little active that they did not write enough to make
mistakes, so we keep only users who have written at least 100 words. Also, to exclude
cells with too little statistics, in the following we only keep cells with at least 15
residents left after this previous filter. This leaves us with \SI{131402}{} users
spread across \SI{4879}{} \acp{MSOA}. In each of these cells, our analysis yields an
estimate of the income of its residents and of the frequency at which they make grammar
mistakes. The result of our data processing is available in the form of aggregated data
that we deposited on a public repository \cite{LoufFrequencyDetected2023}.


\subsection{Correlations with the frequency of mistakes}
We find a significant, but weak correlation (Pearson r equal to -0.25) between the net
income and the average frequency of mistakes in all cells of the country, as shown in
the top left panel of \cref{fig:ses_x_grammar_corrs}. We then focus on metropolitan
areas because we expect them to host more linguistic and socio-economic heterogeneity
than their rural counterparts. We also happen to have more data in these on both
mobility and language production, due to the fact that Twitter users tend to be more
urban \cite{MisloveUnderstandingDemographics2011}. We therefore consider the 8 largest
metropolitan areas in England, and find large differences between these areas, with
correlations ranging from -0.07 in Sheffield to -0.5 in Bristol. The average frequency
of grammar mistakes is plotted against the average of net annual income of their
residents for all \acp{MSOA} of England and Wales, London, Manchester and Sheffield in
\cref{fig:ses_x_grammar_corrs}.
\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ses_x_grammar_corrs}
  \caption{ Correlation between frequency of grammar mistakes and net income. We show
  them for all \acp{MSOA} of England and Wales, and then of the metropolitan areas of
  London, Manchester and Sheffield. Each grey dot corresponds to an \ac{MSOA}, while
  blue lines indicate the result of a linear regression, with the corresponding Pearson
  r and p-value given in each legend. The areas coloured in light blue indicate the
  \SI{95}{\percent} confidence interval for the regression estimates.}
  \label{fig:ses_x_grammar_corrs}
\end{figure}


\subsection{The role of assortativity}
% \cite{EagleNetworkDiversity2010} We find that the diversity of individualsâ€™
% relationships is strongly correlated with the economic development of communities.
% hence why we turn to measuring social mixing next. hein??

To find out what could make these cities so different in that regard, we measure the
assortativity in the mobility patterns of their residents
\cite{HilmanSocioeconomicBiases2022}. We thus determine how likely people from different
socio-economic classes are to interact with each other.

\Ac{SES} classes are defined such that each class has roughly the same population. Since
our proxy for \ac{SES} is the average income in every \ac{MSOA}, every resident of a
cell will necessarily be assigned to the same class. Considering the cells in a given
metropolitan area, we rank them by increasing average net income. We get their
population from the
census\footnote{\url{https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/ks101uk}}, denoted $N_c$ for
each cell $c$ in the following. Denoting $P_c$ the set of cells less populated than $c$,
formally defined as $P_c = \left\{ c' \in C \mid N_{c'} < N_c \right\}$, we determine the
\ac{SES} class of $c$ as:
\begin{equation}
  S_c = n_S \left\lceil \frac{\sum_{c' \in P_c} N_{c'}}{\sum_{c' \in C} N_{c'}} \right\rceil,
\end{equation}
with $\left\lceil \cdot \right\rceil$ representing the ceiling function and $n_S$ the
number of classes we wish to define. We denote $t_{u, c}$ the number of trips made by
user $u$ to cell $c$, and introduce the probability for an individual residing in a cell
of class $i$ to visit another of class $j$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:class_visit_proba}
  M_{i, j} = \frac{
      \sum_{u \in S_i} \sum_{c \in S_j} t_{u, c}
    }{
      \sum_{j \in S_j} \sum_{u \in S_i} \sum_{c \in S_j} t_{u, c}
    },
\end{equation}
which is normalised row-wise, meaning $\sum_j M_{i, j} = 1$. Since we are interested in
how much individuals mix when they move, we exclude the tweets sent from their cell of
residence to compute $M_{i, j}$. Such matrices computed for our eight metropolitan areas
are represented in \cref{fig:cities_SES_mobility}. They show completely different
patterns, from cities where the diagonal elements slightly stand out as in London or
Manchester, to cities in which one specific class of cells is the destination of most
outward mobility, as in Newcastle or Bristol.
\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{cities_SES_mobility}
  \caption{ Matrices of stratification of \ac{SES} classes in their mobility in eight
  metropolitan areas of England. For every pair of \ac{SES} classes for the cell of
  residence and the cell visited by Twitter users, this shows the proportion of trips
  that were made from the latter to the former. A square located at $(x, y) = (i, j)$
  corresponds to $M_{j, i}$, as it is defined in \cref{eq:class_visit_proba}. The
  normalisation is thus column-wise on this representation.}
  \label{fig:cities_SES_mobility}
\end{figure}

These patterns can be summarised by a measure of how strongly diagonal these matrices
are: their Pearson r value, denoted $r_M$ in our case. It is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:def_mobility_r}
  r_M = \frac{
      \sum_{i, j} M_{i, j} \cdot \sum_{i, j} i j M_{i, j}
      - \sum_{i, j} i M_{i, j} \cdot \sum_{i, j} j M_{i, j}
    }{
      \sqrt{\sum_{i, j} i^2 M_{i, j} - \left( \sum_{i, j} i M_{i, j} \right)^2}
      \cdot \sqrt{\sum_{i, j} j^2 M_{i, j} - \left( \sum_{i, j} j M_{i, j} \right)^2}
    }.
\end{equation}
This gives us a measure of assortativity, meaning that this metric gives us a sense of
how much people of similar classes tend to stay together. The closer to 1, the more
individuals tend to go to areas of similar \ac{SES} (assortative mixing), and the closer
to -1, the more they will stay with people of opposite \ac{SES} (disassortative mixing).
Values close to 0 indicate no assortativity, meaning no preference in mixing. We measure
this assortativity for our metropolitan areas from the matrices shown in
\cref{fig:cities_SES_mobility}, and present the results in
\cref{fig:cities_assort_vs_grammar_and_SES_corr} against the correlation we computed
previously between socio-economic status and the average frequency of grammar mistakes.
What we find is a very clear correlation between this assortativity measured at the city
level, and the correlation between \ac{SES} and the frequency of grammar mistakes. This
indicates that the more mixing in the population, the less the frequency of mistakes is
determined by the \ac{SES} of origin. Further, as shown in the bottom panel of
\cref{fig:cities_assort_vs_grammar_and_SES_corr}, more mixing tends to imply more
frequent mistakes. It then appears to favour the spread in popularity of non-standard
English.

  \caption{The influence of assortativity on the frequency of grammar mistakes (bottom)
  and their dependence on \ac{SES} of origin (top). The latter clearly decreases as
  assortativity increases. This means that the more \ac{SES} classes mix with one
  another, the less the usage of the standard form of individuals will depend on their
  own \ac{SES}. As for the frequency of mistakes, it seems to rather increase with
  mixing.}

\section{A model for language variety adoption}

\subsection{Definition}
Having identified the importance of social mixing, we wish to understand the mechanisms
behind this observation with a simple model.
% There are models for cultural transmission, like the literature centered around the
% Axelrod model
% \cite{AxelrodDisseminationCulture1997,CastellanoNonequilibriumPhase2000,KlemmGlobalCulture2003,KlemmNonequilibriumTransitions2003,BattistonLayeredSocial2017}.
% No dependence on intrinsic attribute, or group identity, have been taken into account.
% Cultural traits like the use of a language variety can depend on an individual sense of
% identity.
There are several effects we wish to
consider, described below.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item One of the two varieties of the language may be more prestigious than the other.
  This is for example the case of the standard form: it is taught at schools and spoken
  by mainstream media and public institutions \cite{DavilaInevitabilityStandard2016}.
  \item Even though one variety is less prestigious, it might still be preferred by a
  part of the population that has some kind of cultural attachment to it. For instance,
  slang can be preferred by members of lower \ac{SES}, as using it might give them a
  sense of group identity
  \cite{LabovSocialStratification1966,TrudgillSocialDifferentiation1974}.
  \item We previously observed very different mixing patterns in English metropolises.
  Indeed, mobility can be very heterogeneous, so it should be possible to plug in any
  mobility pattern into the model to be able to understand how different mixing may
  affect the dynamics of the linguistic varieties.
\end{enumerate}
With these considerations in mind, we propose an \ac{ABM}, that we describe next. It
considers agent who can have one of two \ac{SES} classes,
% each class living in one of
% two cells, and
% TODO: keep this way? stay general on number of cells/classes?
who can either speak standard, or not. The standard form has an intrinsic prestige
$l_v$, the value of which belongs to the unit interval, but that we will always set
above 0.5 in the following, to account for (i). Now turning to (ii), each \ac{SES} class
has a preference for one form: the lower class 1 is attached to the non-standard form
(denoted 1) with a factor $q_1$, and inversely the higher class 2 is attached to the
standard one (denoted 2) with $q_2$. They are also comprised between 0 and 1, and when
one of these two parameters has a value above $0.5$, it means there is a preference for
the respective form. Then for instance, when an agent of \ac{SES} class 1 speaking
non-standard interacts with another agent speaking standard, they have a probability
$l_v (1 - q_1)$ to start using the standard form as well. The agents can move from their
residence cell with a probability $M_{i,j}$ at each step, which thus controls the mixing
of the two populations, as discussed in (iii). A summary diagram of the model is
provided in \cref{fig:model_diagram}.
\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{model_diagram}
  \caption{Diagram summarizing our agent-based model for the adoption of a language
  variety. It features two \ac{SES} classes, represented by circles and triangles, which
  can speak one of two varieties of their language: the standard form (filled shapes)
  and the non-standard (empty shapes). Each agent has a cell of residence, and a
  mobility matrix with elements $M_{i, j}$ defines the probabilities for a resident of
  $i$ to be at different cells at each time step. After they have moved, for every
  agent, another agent is picked randomly for them to interact with, and if they happen
  to interact with an agent using the other variety, in function of their \ac{SES} class
  of origin they have different probabilities to adopt this variety. For instance, when
  a triangle (\ac{SES} 1) speaking non-standard interacts with another agent speaking
  standard, they have a probability equal to $l_v (1 - q_1)$ to adopt the standard form
  (transition represented in the bottom left).}

\subsection{Properties and behaviour in mean-field}
\graffito{Figures shown in this section were generated with Mathematica code, freely
available on GitHub \cite{LoufSeslinganalytical2023}.} The process we just described
above can be simulated for any number of cells and arrangements of the populations of
different \ac{SES} classes. Here, however, we will consider a rather simple case in
order to present succinct equations that lend themselves to interpretation and
mathematical analysis. We will consider only two cells, with $N_1$ individuals of class
1 residing in cell 1, and $N_2$ individuals of class 2 residing in cell 2. We will write
$p_1$ the proportion of individuals of class 1 speaking non-standard (variety 1), and
$p_2$ the proportion of individuals of class 2 speaking standard (variety 2).
Individuals have to speak either 1 or 2, which implies that, for instance, a proportion
$(1 - p_1)$ of individuals of class 1 speak the variety 2. The two variables therefore
summarise the linguistic state of the system at any given time. Regarding the mobility,
we introduce a new variable $m_{i, j}$, such that:
\begin{equation}
  m_{i, j} \equiv \frac{N_{i} M_{i, j}}{\sum_{i'} N_{s_{i'}} M_{i', j}},
\end{equation}
which can be understood as the probability to pick from $j$ an individual with residence
in $i$. They satisfy $\sum_i m_{i, j} = 1$. Further, since there are only two cells,
people either stay at their residence or move to the other cell. As a result, to account
for different mobility patterns, out of the $2 \times 2$ mobility matrix with elements
$M_{i, j}$, we only retain the parameters $M_1 \equiv M_{1, 2}$ and $M_2 \equiv M_{2,
1}$, the probabilities for people of each class to move away from their residence cell.
Note that these parameters summarise how much the classes mix, as the mobility
matrix' Pearson r of \cref{eq:def_mobility_r} satisfies $r_M = 1 - M_1 - M_2$. Likewise,
the matrix of $m_{i, j}$ can be summarised with the corresponding $m_1$ and $m_2$. Under
all these assumptions and new notation, we can then write the probability to pick an
individual speaking a variety in each cell as:
% TODO: ref appendix? include this here?
\begin{equation}
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
      P(2 \mid c = c_1)
          = (1 - m_2) (1 - p_1) + m_2 p_2
      \\
      P(2 \mid c = c_2)
          = m_1 (1 - p_1) + (1 - m_1) p_2
      \\
      P(1 \mid c = c_1)
          = (1 - m_2) p_1 + m_2 (1 - p_2)
      \\
      P(1 \mid c = c_2)
          = m_1 p_1 + (1 - m_1) (1 - p_2)
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
\end{equation}
This allows us to write the probabilities to switch from one variant to
another depending on one's \ac{SES} class:
\begin{equation}
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
      P(1 \rightarrow 2 \mid s = s_1)
          &= l_v (1 - q_1)
          \begin{aligned}[t]
            &[P(2 \mid c = c_1) (1 - M_1)
            \\
            &+ P(2 \mid c = c_2) M_1]
          \end{aligned}
      \\[1ex]
      P(1 \rightarrow 2 \mid s = s_2)
          &= l_v q_2
          \begin{aligned}[t]
              &[P(2 \mid c = c_1) M_2
              \\
              &+ P(2 \mid c = c_2)(1 - M_2)]
          \end{aligned}
      \\[1ex]
      P(2 \rightarrow 1 \mid s = s_1)
          &= (1 - l_v) q_1
          \begin{aligned}[t]
              &[P(1 \mid c = c_1) (1 - M_1)
              \\
              & + P(1 \mid c = c_2) M_1]
          \end{aligned}
      \\[1ex]
      P(2 \rightarrow 1 \mid s = s_2)
          &= (1 - l_v) (1 - q_2)
          \begin{aligned}[t]
              &[P(1 \mid c = c_1) M_2
              \\
              &+ P(1 \mid c = c_2) (1 - M_2)]
          \end{aligned}
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
\end{equation}
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:final_trans_probs}
%   \begin{aligned}
%       P(1 \rightarrow 2 \mid s = s_1)
%           &= l_v (1 - q_1) [
%             (1 - M_1) P(2 \mid c = c_1)  + M_1 P(2 \mid c = c_2)
%           ]
%       \\
%       P(1 \rightarrow 2 \mid s = s_2)
%           &= l_v q_2 [
%             M_2 P(2 \mid c = c_1) + (1 - M_2) P(2 \mid c = c_2)
%           ]
%       \\
%       P(2 \rightarrow 1 \mid s = s_1)
%           &= (1 - l_v) q_1 [
%             (1 - M_1)P(1 \mid c = c_1) + M_1 P(1 \mid c = c_2)
%             ]
%       \\
%       P(2 \rightarrow 1 \mid s = s_2)
%           &= (1 - l_v) (1 - q_2) [
%             M_2 P(1 \mid c = c_1) + (1 - M_2) P(1 \mid c = c_2)
%           ]
%   \end{aligned}
% \end{equation}
Subsequently, working in mean field, we can write the following system of differential
equations:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ses_ling_time_evol}
    \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
        % v and c depend on t
        \dv{p_1}{t} 
            &= (1 - p_1) P(2 \rightarrow 1 \mid s = s_1)
                - p_1 P(1 \rightarrow 2 \mid s = s_1)
        \\
        \dv{p_2}{t} 
            &= (1 - p_2) P(1 \rightarrow 2 \mid s = s_2)
                 - p_2 P(2 \rightarrow 1 \mid s = s_2)
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
\end{equation}

Now if we simplify further and assume that the two \ac{SES} classes have the same
population, and the same mobility $M = M_1 = M_2$, then we get that $m_1 = m_2 = M$, and
following the steps detailed in \cref{ch:appendix_ses_model}, we get
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ses_ling_time_evol_eq_mob}
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
      % v and c depend on t
      \dv{p_1}{t}

One can first notice how each equation features a first term linked to the groups'
mobility, maximum for $M = \frac{1}{2}$, which is the situation of maximum mixing. This
term is null when $p_1 = 1 - p_2$, and thus tends to smooth out differences in variety
usage between \ac{SES} classes. Indeed, in the first equation, if $q_1 \leq l_v$, the
term in square brackets is clearly strictly positive. If $q_1 > l_v$, we have
\begin{equation}
  q_1 (1 - l_v) - p_1 (q_1 - l_v) > q_1 (1 - l_v) - (q_1 - l_v) = l_v (1 - q_1) > 0.
\end{equation}
It results that th mobility term's sign follows the one of $(1 - p_1 - p_2)$. It is
therefore negative if $p_1 > 1 - p_2$ and positive otherwise, meaning it pushes $p_1$
towards $1 - p_2$. Similarly, in the second equation, since $q_2 l_v - q_2 - l_v > -1$,
the mobility term pushes $p_2$ towards $1 - p_1$.

The second term of each evolution equation is one of ``self-growth'', independent of
mobility and maximum for $p_k = \frac{1}{2}$. This term thus pushes a given class $k$
away from a state of maximum entropy, and rather towards homogeneity. For $k = 1$ for
instance, it does it either towards $p_1 = 0$ for $q_1 < l_v$, or towards $p_1 = 1$ for
$q_1 > l_v$. When there is no mixing, for $M = 0$ or $M = 1$, as expected the two
populations become completely independent, and one can directly see that the only stable
fixed points of the system are homogeneous populations in terms of the variety they use.
Which one they will end up using depends on the sign of $(q_1 - l_v)$ and $(l_v + q_2 -
1)$ for classes 1 and 2, respectively.

This system of equation lends itself to further mathematical analysis, in particular of its
fixed points and their stability. Two fixed points can be trivially found from a quick
look at \cref{eq:ses_ling_time_evol_eq_mob}: they are $(p_1, p_2) = (0, 1)$ and $(1,
0)$. As in \cref{ch:multiling}, we compute the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the system
evaluated at the fixed points, and are thus able to say that a fixed point is stable if
and only if all the corresponding eigenvalues have a strictly negative real part. For $M
= 0.2$, $q_2= 0.5$, $q_1 = 0.7$, and $l_v \in \{ 0.5, 0.6, 0.7\}$, we show in
\cref{fig:mean_field_analytic_coex_pos}(a-b-c) the position of the fixed points of the
model and whether they are stable, within stream plots that give a glimpse of the
dynamics leading to convergence.
\begin{figure}

  \caption{Properties of the model's fixed points in a simple setting. We here analyse
  the mean-field form of the model, given in \cref{eq:ses_ling_time_evol_eq_mob}, with
  $q_2$ set at the neutral value of $0.5$. Stream plots show the fixed points of the
  model for $M = 0.2$, $q_1 = 0.7$ and (a) $l_v = 0.5$, (b) $l_v = 0.6$ and (c) $l_v =
  0.7$. The points $(1, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$ are shown to consistently feature as fixed
  points, the first being stable for $l_v$ significantly lower than $q_1$ (a) and the
  second for $l_v$ close to or higher than $q_1$ (c). A third fixed point featuring
  coexistence of the two varieties may appear for intermediate values of $l_v$ (c). (d)
  For $l_v = 0.6$ as in (b) are also shown trajectories of the stable fixed point
  corresponding to coexistence when varying $M$ from $0$ to $0.5$, for different values
  of $q_1$, written in grey next to the corresponding lines. This shows how increasing
  $M$ moves the stable fixed point of coexistence toward the dashed line corresponding
  to $p_2 = 1 - p_1$, and towards the extinction of variety 1 or 2 for respectively low
  or high values of $q_1$.}
  \label{fig:mean_field_analytic_coex_pos}
\end{figure}
For $l_v$ significantly lower than $q_1$ as in panel (a), the stable fixed point is that
of dominance of variety 1, while $l_v = q_1$ implies a stable dominance of variety 2, as
shown in panel (c). Coexistence of the two varieties is possible for intermediate values
of $l_v < q_1$, such as $0.6$ in panel (c). As shown in
\cref{sec:appendix_coex_sol_ses_model}, $l_v < q_1$ is actually a strong requirement for
the existence of a fixed point corresponding to coexistence.
\Cref{fig:mean_field_analytic_coex_pos} shows how this stable fixed point moves in the
$(p_1, p_2)$ space when varying $M$, for $l_v = 0.6$ and different values of $q_1$. As
shown earlier, increasing $M$ does push the system towards $p_2 = 1 - p_1$, and whether
it is biased in favour of variety 1 or 2 depends on the difference between $q_1$ and
$l_v$.

\Cref{fig:mean_field_analytic_q-M_space} presents the regions of the $(q_1, M)$ space
where the kinds of stable solutions we just mentioned appear. For a prestige favouring
variety 2, but still low enough as in the left panel, three distinct domains appear in
the parameter space: two corresponding to dominance of one variety and extinction of the
other, and a third corresponding to coexistence of the two varieties. Higher values of
$l_v$ prohibit stable solutions associated to the dominance of 1, as shown in the right
panel. Coexistence is facilitated by less mixing between the different classes, so this
coexistence is a relatively separate one. Still, for a given range of values of $q_1$,
no matter how much populations mix, the two varieties can still coexist.

  regions of the $(q_1, M)$ parameter space where different kinds of stable solutions
  emerge are shown, for $l_v = 0.6$ (left) and $l_v = 0.7$ (right). There are three such
  kinds: the extinction of variety 2 and dominance of 1 labelled with ``$1$'', inversely
  the dominance of 2 labelled with ``$2$'', and the coexistence of both varieties
  labelled with ``$1~\&~2$''. Examples for each of these are respectively shown in
  \cref{fig:mean_field_analytic_coex_pos}(a-c-b). Stable coexistence of varieties 1 and
  2 is favoured for rather low mobility and a preference of class 1 for variety 1 $q_1$
  higher than the second variety's prestige $l_v$.}

\subsection{Simulations in real metropolitan areas}
These interesting properties of the model call for further investigation, and
particularly how it would fare when initialised with the actual data that we have in the
metropolitan areas of England.
