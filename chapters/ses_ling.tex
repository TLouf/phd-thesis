Language bounds individuals together just as much as it divides them. Upon reading the
last sentence, one may first think of interlanguage boundaries as the ones we have seen
in the previous chapter: if two individuals cannot understand each other's language,
communication is effectively very limited. This chapter, on the other hand, is dedicated
to intra-language differences: when people speak the same language, but differently,
which is also a strong marker of social divides. As we already emphasized in
\cref{ch:origins_lang_diversity}, language variation in a population is driven by many
factors, among which the socio-economic background of individuals is essential. And as
we also said previously, one's ability to use the standard form of their language can be
associated to a higher linguistic capital, and has thus economic values. It is not
uncommon that some classes of the population, particularly those of relatively low
\ac{SES}, prefer to use the non-standard form. This has been shown by prominent
sociolinguists in the past, as they conducted field studies and analysed differences
between socio-economic classes
\cite{LabovSocialStratification1966,TrudgillSocialDifferentiation1974}. Although this
phenomenon has long been known \cite{ChambersSociolinguisticTheory2007}, it has been
observed on very limited scales, and, more importantly, no real explanation of how it
might emerge has been proposed. These are the two shortcomings we wish to address in
this chapter. As groups of lower \ac{SES} have less linguistic capital, their economic
opportunities will also be affected. \Ac{SES} and this linguistic variation are thus
mutually sustaining: one inherits a \ac{SES} along which comes a linguistic capital that
contributes --- among other things --- to constrain them to their status of origin.
Understanding the mechanisms that lead to this linguistic segregation is therefore of
great importance. 

First, as we have already shown in previous chapters, a first step toward understanding
is to measure the phenomenon. It has already been quantified by the PISA reports of the
OECD \cite{OECDWhereAll2019}, which consistently show that students with lower
socio-economic background tend to have a lower reading proficiency. While these confirm
there is an issue to tackle, they are not extensive enough. They do not test language
production, and not the whole population but only a sample of students of a specific
age. Alternative empirical works are thus needed. Data from social media have repeatedly
proven useful to link \ac{SES} and different social behaviours
\cite{GaoComputationalSocioeconomics2019}. In particular, Twitter data were used in the
past to study geographical variation of linguistic variables
\cite{EisensteinDiffusionLexical2014}. Closer to our topic of interest still, some past
work has investigated the dependence on \ac{SES} of the frequency of a few markers of
non-standard language in France, as seen on Twitter
\cite{AbitbolSocioeconomicDependencies2018}, showing the potential of this data source
for such an analysis. The work presented here starts with an investigation of these
dependencies in the UK, by way of measuring how Twitter users abide by the rules of the
standard variety of their language.


% \cite{LaksWhyThere2013} In such a conception, communication is a leading force in the emergence and stabilization of human linguistic competence, both diachronically and synchronically. In this approach, variation and heterogeneity are to be seen as core factors in shaping language. Thus, as argued some 50 years ago by Weinreich, variation and heterogeneity are to be regarded as structurally functional, and as fundamental dimensions of language.
% \cite{KinzlerNativeLanguage2007} social groups are partly built and opposed based on language, and very early

\section{An influence of socio-economic status?}

\subsection{Twitter data analysis}
To do so, we analyse the tweets of identified UK residents with LanguageTool, an
open-source grammar, style and spell checker. As the tool is implemented in 15
languages, our study can actually be replicated in other countries as well. It enables
us to compute the frequency at which these users make different categories of mistakes,
according to standard rules. To assign a \ac{SES} to these users, we determine their
area of residence from the geotags attached to their tweets. The areas considered are
administrative areas with a typical population of ten thousand. For those, we have the
average annual net income of their residents from the census, which gives us a proxy for
the \ac{SES} of our Twitter users.

Our unit areas for the study are the \SI{7201}{} \acp{MSOA}, which are areas created by
the Office for National Statistics of the UK for the output of the census estimates.
They host at least \SI{5000}{} and at most \SI{15000}{} inhabitants, with a typical
population of \SI{10000}{}. Their boundaries can be downloaded from the Open Geography
portal of the Office for National
Statistics\footnote{\url{https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/maps/msoa-dec-2011-boundaries-generalised-clipped-bgc-ew-v3}}.
In the following, we only keep cells in which we had sufficient text from Twitter. Our
criterion is set so that we keep cells with at least 15 resident users, each of whom
must have written at least 100 words. This leaves us with \SI{4879}{} \acp{MSOA} for our
analysis.


\subsection{SES x grammar mistakes correlations}
The 2018 net annual income for \acp{MSOA} of England and Wales was obtained from the
census\footnote{\url{https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/smallareaincomeestimatesformiddlelayersuperoutputareasenglandandwales}}

Focusing on grammar mistakes, we then find a significant, but weak correlation (Pearson
r equal to -0.25) between the net income and the average frequency of mistakes in all
areas of the country. We then focus on metropolitan areas because we expect them to host
more linguistic and socio-economic heterogeneity than their rural counterparts. We also
happen to have more data in these on both mobility and language production, due to the
fact that Twitter users tend to be more urban. We therefore consider the 8 largest
metropolitan areas in England, and find large differences between these areas, with
correlations ranging from -0.07 in Sheffield to -0.5 in Bristol. The average frequency
of grammar mistakes is plotted against the average of net annual income of their
residents for all \acp{MSOA} of England and Wales, London, Manchester and Sheffield in
\cref{fig:ses_x_grammar_corrs}.
\begin{figure}

  \caption{ Correlation between frequency of grammar mistakes and net income. We show
  them for all \acp{MSOA} of England and Wales, and then of the metropolitan areas of
  London, Manchester and Sheffield. Each grey dot corresponds to an \ac{MSOA}, while
  blue lines indicate the result of a linear regression, with the corresponding Pearson
  r and p-value given in each legend. The areas colored in light blue indicate the
  \SI{95}{\percent} confidence interval for the regression estimates.}

\end{figure}


\subsection{The role of assortativity}
% \cite{EagleNetworkDiversity2010} We find that the diversity of individualsâ€™
% relationships is strongly correlated with the economic development of communities.
% hence why we turn to measuring social mixing next. hein??

To find out what could make these cities so different in that regard, we measure the
assortativity in the mobility patterns of their residents
\cite{HilmanSocioeconomicBiases2022}. We thus determine how likely people from different
socio-economic classes are to interact with each other.

Excluding tweets from their cell of residence. \ac{SES} classes are defined such that
each class has roughly the same population. Since our proxy for \ac{SES} is the average
income in every \ac{MSOA}, every resident of a cell will necessarily be assigned to the
same class. Considering the cells in a given metropolitan area, we rank them by
increasing average net income. We get their population from the
census\footnote{\url{https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/ks101uk}}, denoted $N_c$ for
each cell $c$ in the following. Denoting $P_c$ the set of cells less populated than $c$,
formally defined as $P_c = \left\{ c' \in C \mid N_{c'} < N_c \right\}$, we define the
\ac{SES} class of $c$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
  S_c = n_S \left\lceil \frac{\sum_{c' \in P_c} N_{c'}}{\sum_{c' \in C} N_{c'}} \right\rceil,
\end{equation}
with $\left\lceil \cdot \right\rceil$ representing the ceiling function and $n_S$ the
number of classes we wish to define. We denote $m_{u, c}$ the number of trips made by
user $u$ to cell $c$, and introduce the probability for an individual residing in a cell
of class $i$ to visit another of class $j$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:class_visit_proba}
  M_{i, j} = \frac{
      \sum_{u \in S_i} \sum_{c \in S_j} m_{u, c}
    }{
      \sum_{j \in S_j} \sum_{u \in S_i} \sum_{c \in S_j} m_{u, c}
    },
\end{equation}
which is normalised row-wise, meaning $\sum_j M_{i, j} = 1$. Such matrices computed for
our eight metropolitan areas are represented in \cref{fig:cities_SES_mobility}. They
show completely different patterns, from cities where the diagonal elements slightly
stand out as in London or Manchester, to cities in which one specific class of cells is
the destination of most outward mobility, as in Newcastle or Bristol.
\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{cities_SES_mobility}
  \caption{ Matrices of stratification of \ac{SES} classes in their mobility in eight
  metropolitan areas of England. For every pair of \ac{SES} classes for the cell of
  residence and the cell visited by Twitter users, this shows the proportion of trips
  that were made from the latter to the former. A square located at $(x, y) = (i, j)$
  corresponds to $M_{j, i}$, as it is defined in \cref{eq:class_visit_proba}. The
  normalization is thus column-wise on this representation.}
  \label{fig:cities_SES_mobility}
\end{figure}

These patterns can be summarised by a measure of how strongly diagonal these matrices
are: their Pearson r value, denoted $r_M$ in our case. It is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
  r_M = \frac{
      \sum_{i, j} M_{i, j} \cdot \sum_{i, j} i j M_{i, j}
      - \sum_{i, j} i M_{i, j} \cdot \sum_{i, j} j M_{i, j}
    }{
      \sqrt{\sum_{i, j} i^2 M_{i, j} - \left( \sum_{i, j} i M_{i, j} \right)^2}
      \cdot \sqrt{\sum_{i, j} j^2 M_{i, j} - \left( \sum_{i, j} j M_{i, j} \right)^2}
    }.
\end{equation}
This then gives us a measure of assortativity, meaning that this metric gives us a sense
of how much people of similar classes tend to stay together. The closer to 1, the more
individuals tend to go to areas of similar \ac{SES} (assortative mixing), and the closer
to -1, the more they will stay with people of opposite \ac{SES} (disassortative mixing).
Values close to 0 indicate no assortativity, meaning no preference in mixing. We then
measure this assortativity for our metropolitan areas from the matrices shown in
\cref{fig:cities_SES_mobility}, and show the results in
\cref{fig:cities_assort_vs_grammar_and_SES_corr} against the correlation we computed
previously between socio-economic status and the average frequency of grammar mistakes.
What we find is a very clear correlation between this assortativity measured at the city
level, and the correlation between SES and the frequency of grammar mistakes, as shown
in Figure \cref{fig:cities_assort_vs_grammar_and_SES_corr}. This indicates that the more
mixing in the population, the less the frequency of mistakes is determined by the SES of
origin. Further, as shown in the bottom panel of
\cref{fig:cities_assort_vs_grammar_and_SES_corr}, more mixing tends to imply more
frequent mistakes. It then appears that it favours the spread in popularity of
non-standard English.

  \caption{The influence of assortativity on the frequency of grammar mistakes (bottom)
  and their dependence on \ac{SES} of origin (top). The latter clearly decreases as
  assortativity increases. This means that the more \ac{SES} classes mix with one
  another, the less the usage of the standard form of individuals will depend on their
  own \ac{SES}. As for the frequency of mistakes, it seems to rather increase with
  mixing.}

\section{Model}

\subsection{Definition}
Having identified the importance of social mixing, we wish to understand the mechanisms
behind this observation with a simple model.
% There are models for cultural transmission, like the literature centered around the
% Axelrod model
% \cite{AxelrodDisseminationCulture1997,CastellanoNonequilibriumPhase2000,KlemmGlobalCulture2003,KlemmNonequilibriumTransitions2003,BattistonLayeredSocial2017}.
% No dependence on intrinsic attribute, or group identity, have been taken into account.
% Cultural traits like the use of a language variety can depend on an individual sense of
% identity.
There are several effects we wish to
consider, described below.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item One of the two varieties of the language may be more prestigious than the other.
  This is for example the case of the standard form: it is taught at schools and spoken
  by mainstream media and public institutions \cite{DavilaInevitabilityStandard2016}.
  \item Even though one variety is less prestigious, it might still be preferred by a
  part of the population that has some kind of cultural attachment to it. For instance,
  slang can be preferred by members of lower \ac{SES}, as using it might give them a
  sense of group identity
  \cite{LabovSocialStratification1966,TrudgillSocialDifferentiation1974}.
  \item We previously observed very different mixing patterns in UK metropolises.
  Indeed, mobility can be very heterogeneous, so it should be possible to plug in any
  mobility pattern into the model to be able to understand how different mixing may
  affect the dynamics of the linguistic varieties.
\end{enumerate}
With these considerations in mind, we propose an \ac{ABM}, that we describe next. It
considers agent who can have one of two \ac{SES} classes, each class living in one of
two cells, and who can either speak standard, or not. The standard form has an intrinsic
prestige $l_v$, whose values we will always set above 0.5 in the following, to account
for (i). Now turning to (ii), each \ac{SES} class has a preference for one form: the
lower class 1 is attached to the non-standard form with a factor $q_1$, and inversely
the higher class 2 is attached to the standard one with $q_2$. When one of these three
parameters has a value above $0.5$, it means there is a preference for the respective
form. Then for instance, when an agent of low \ac{SES} speaking non-standard interacts
with another agent speaking standard, they have a probability $l_v (1 - q_1)$ to start
using the standard form as well. The agents can move from their residence cell with a
probability $m_{i,j}$ at each step, which thus controls the mixing of the two
populations, as discussed in (iii). \cref{fig:model_diagram} provides a summary of the
model.
\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{model_diagram}
  \caption{Diagram summarizing our agent-based model for the adoption of a linguistic
  variety. It features two \ac{SES} classes, represented by circles and triangles, which
  can speak one of two varieties of their language: the standard form (filled shapes)
  and the non-standard (empty shapes). Each agent has a cell of residence, and a
  mobility matrix with elements $m_{i, j}$ defines the probabilities for a resident of
  $i$ to be at different cells at each time step. After they have moved, for every
  agent, another agent is picked randomly for them to interact with, and if they happen
  to interact with an agent using the other variety, in function of their \ac{SES} class
  of origin they have different probabilities to adopt this variety. For instance, when
  a triangle (\ac{SES} 1) speaking non-standard interacts with another agent speaking
  standard, they have a probability equal to $l_v (1 - q_1)$ to adopt the standard form
  (transition represented in the bottom left).}
  \label{fig:model_diagram}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Properties of the model and behaviour in mean-field}
% fig with analytic result, stream plots, this kind of thing


\subsection{Simulating the model on a toy example}
We ran simulations with $200$ agents spread evenly between two SES classes, with each
class in its own residence cell. We set the standard form to be the more prestigious
one, agents with higher SES to be indifferent and ones with lower SES to be more
attached to the non-standard form. In Figure \cref{fig}(c), we show the result of this
simulation when we set a very low inter-cell mobility. For Figure \cref{fig}(d), the
mobility was greatly increased. We can see that the more the two populations mix, the
closer they are to using the two forms in the same proportions, reflecting what we
observed in the data.


\subsection{Simulating the model in real metropolitan areas}
This promising result calls for further investigation of the model, and particularly how
it would fare when initialised with the actual data that we have in the metropolitan
areas of England.
