\section{Summary of our findings}
Throughout this thesis, we have strived to push further the understanding of
sociolinguistic phenomena, by first and foremost always relying on some representative
measurement of these phenomena, in particular from social media data. Delving into large
amounts of data allows us to give quantitative descriptions, but we should and did not
stop at these, and proposed theoretical models inspired by complexity science that are
the ones really that can really push further our understanding, and also lay down a
fertile ground for later developments.

In the first study we presented in \cref{ch:multiling}, we applied this methodological
framework to the study of language diversity and its decline, and the potential for a
recovery. Leveraging geotagged Twitter data from multilingual regions around the globe,
we observed and quantified how the distributions of speakers of different languages can
display widely different spatial arrangements. Indeed, if those were random, people from
different linguistic communities would be spread evenly, and the geographical
distribution of each group should be indistinguishable from the whole. We thus
quantified how these groups were segregated by introducing the \ac{EMR}, which
quantifies the departure from this state. At the two extremes, we found regions in which
language groups are almost completely separated, such as Switzerland or Belgium, and
others in which they mix indifferently, such as Catalonia or Galicia. We subsequently
proposed a model that tries to capture the mechanisms behind this observation. It
features two languages, and individuals that can speak one of the two languages, or
both. The transition probabilities from one language group to another do not only depend
on the proportion of speakers of each langauge, or on the external prestige attributed
by institutions to one of the two languages, that were introduced in previous studies,
but also on the relative ease to learn one language when knowing the other, and on the
preference of bilinguals for one of the two languages. To understand if and how stable
coexistence of languages may emerge within this model, we determined the stable fixed
points of the model in mean-field and set in an interconnected population. The two
parameters we introduced were found to be crucial to pass from stable solutions of
extinction and dominance to ones of coexistence. They even allow to have a stable
community of bilingual sustain a minority language. Then, as there still remained to
understand how different spatial configurations can emerge, we simulated the model in a
metapopulation framework, incorporating the daily commuting of individuals in Belgium.
Remarkably, we found that the present state featuring a boundary between Flemish and
French can be stable if the relative rate of learning the other language remains low
enough. Further, if the latter increases, at some point bilingualism would spread in the
country, as is the case in Catalonia. Still, if it increases, but not enough, one
language may actually spread over the boundary and overshadow the other. Our modelling
effort has thus proved fruitful, as it uncovered that cultural attachment to a language
and policies facilitating language learning can be critical in enabling language
coexistence.

Our second study presented in \cref{ch:ses} is very much similar to the first in terms
of methodology, but it is however applied to a very different issue. This time, we
looked into variation within a language, and in particular into variations away from the
standard form, and how this variation may arise from socio-economic segregation. We therefore focussed on one language in particular, the English language, and in one country, the UK. 

In \cref{ch:acr}, we again focus on the English language, but this time on the US to
investigate how lexical variation may reflect cultural differences.

\subsection{Crossing disciplinary boundaries}
Given this approach that I took throughout these years of PhD, it is only natural that I ended up crossing disciplinary boundaries. In practice, this is reflected first in the researchers I had the chance to collaborate with
% I had the opportunity to work with Jack Grieve, who is, among other things, a
% computational sociolinguist. This made me aware of a whole new range of literature and research areas I had never heard of. This is again, mostly, because this literature was from people outside of the field of complexity science, and consequently published in different journals.

Second, and as just said above, this is partly due to our first point: this
cross-disciplinarity is apparent from the diversity of literature cited throughout this
thesis. I can illustrate how twisted navigating this diversity can be, but how rewarding
it is with the example of how I stumbled upon a metric such as the \ac{EMD}, that I use
in \cref{ch:multiling}.
% came to me from: I need some kind of distance between two probability distributions embedded in a metric space.
First finding out the shortcomings of spatial entropies, widely accepted in the field of
spatial complex systems \cite{BattyEntropyComplexity2014} It has mainly been used within
the field of computer vision \cite{RubnerMetricDistributions1998}, and it was shown to
be a proper distance (in the metric sense) between probability distributions
\cite{LevinaEarthMover2001}. Nothing but a particular version of the Wasserstein or
Mallows distance, well known in transport theory. Only to find out a year after writing
this article that the geographer
\citefirstlastauthor{JakubsDistancebasedSegregation1981} had defined a metric equivalent
to the \ac{EMR} in 1981 \cite{JakubsDistancebasedSegregation1981}, much before computer
vision had the occasion to exploit it. Natural that different fields end up using
different terms. In this case, mathematicians have defined a general distance, which is
used in other applied fields within a particular case. So the mathematicians need this
more general name. And would anyone really think that a geographer or engineer in
computer vision should give up the very evocative \ac{EMD} in favour of ``the
Wasserstein 1-distance on discrete empirical distributions''? So what can be done to
bridge these gaps? Mostly curiosity that drove me to find all of this out. One should
not be afraid to search for literature outside of their field, and to simply acknowledge
them. Citing a work outside of your field is much more valuable than citing another
everyone within your field, who are probably going to be most of your readers, already
know.

\subsection{Science and trends}
% At the end of these roughly 3 years and a half, there is one thing I am particularly
% proud of: the word ``COVID'' does not appear once in any of my works. Some may say they
% heard society's cry for help and flew to its rescue. While some may have had this kind
% of genuine intentions, I remain quite sceptical that everyone who jumped on the
% scientific hype train had them. Some may seem more like churning out more material for
% the scientific publishing machine. But the truth is, I do not know anything about
% epidemiology, and it does not interest me at all.

The number of researchers interested in language competition models like the one we
presented in \cref{ch:multiling} is very low. The hype has passed, it was 20 years ago
when \citeauthor{AbramsModellingDynamics2003} published a piece in \textit{Nature}. Yet
the problem has not been solved at all, as we have shown ourselves. 



\section{Uncharted directions worth exploring}
While I believe the results summarised above provide valuable insights to
sociolinguistic matters, they leave many questions unanswered, and maybe even raise more
questions than answers. In the following I will list some potential directions for
future research that could build on top of the work we have presented here. First are
the directions that naturally emerge from the following question: what else could the
approaches or methods we have developed be applied to?

For instance, can the model of language shift we presented in \cref{ch:multiling} be
equally applied to diachronic data? A dataset with historical data spanning centuries
was for example used recently in \cite{SeoaneAreDutch2022}. One could try to see if our
model can be fit to these data, and, if not, what ingredients may be missing. A
comparison with the results obtained in \cite{SeoaneAreDutch2022} with a different model
can also bring valuable insights to the field. 

The central idea behind the inference of American cultural regions we presented in
\cref{ch:acr} can also lead to many further developments. One could look at countries
that share a language and uncover their cultural differences. Interesting questions can
then be investigated. Can some areas of a country be more similar to another country's
than their own? It would also be interesting to see how the colonial past of some
countries is reflected in those. Did more conflictual decolonisation processes lead to
starker cultural differences? Or, does a more recent split imply more similarity?

The second kind of directions are not based on methodology, but rather on gaps in
understanding that remain open.

An idea about modelling language competition that is worth looking into and that we have
not mentioned yet is to consider language as a property not only of the individuals but
also of their interactions, as suggested in \cite{CarroCoupledDynamics2016}. Indeed, as
shown in this article, a language might be preserved within a tight-knit community that
uses it internally, while being able to switch to another to communicate with others.
This applies to language shift models of \cref{ch:multiling}, but also to models of
usage of a language's varieties, as the one of \cref{ch:ses_ling}. What is missing here
is more empirical work on the question. This would imply a considerable effort, as
obtaining a network of interactions along with the language in which they take place
from real-world data is very challenging. But this direction shows great promise, so
these efforts to put together such a dataset may well be worthwhile.

% something on ses-ling?

Third are simply interesting questions that arose while I worked on this thesis, as, while investigating matters of sociolinguistics, we stumbled upon interesting
issues in social science that are not confined to the realm of linguistics.

One is segregation. This theme permeates \cref{ch:multiling},
\cref{ch:ses_ling}, and also \cref{ch:acr} to a lesser extent. But these are
segregations of different kinds: linguistic, cultural and socio-economic. A question
that remains very much open is how these types of segregation are interrelated, also
taking into account the segregation in social contacts, also known as assortativity or
homophily.

Both models presented in \cref{ch:multiling} and \cref{ch:ses_ling} integrate effects of social pressure. They simply assume that the most people around you speaks a language or a variety, the more likely you are to adopt it too.
% in psychology \cite{LatanePsychologySocial1981}. Link with social contagion on complex networks \cite{WattsInfluentialsNetworks2007}, including recent investigations into higher-order effect \cite{IacopiniSimplicialModels2019}. threshold effect vs psychosocial law, that states that the $N^\text{th}$ with some behaviour has less impact on you than the $(N - 1)^\text{th}$, which is equivalent to having a sublinear functional dependence of social impact on the proportion of different agents ($a < 1$ in the models presented in \cref{ch:multiling}).

Another is the impact of cultural differences on social behaviours in general. What
features matter the most when building social groups? How does this change from one area
of the world to another?

There are thus many more directions worth exploring, and, for now, to most questions the
most sensible answer I can provide is: I don't know. But while one could consider
knowledge as comforting some faith in the universe, I believe uncertainty to be much
more entertaining. Let us then keep asking questions to keep things that way.
% But while at first the realisation that one cannot know everything might make one's lose faith in the universe.
At last, it may seem that the quest for understanding paradoxically leads to less
understanding, but not to worry,

% as the poet would say,
