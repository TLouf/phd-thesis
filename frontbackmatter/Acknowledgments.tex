\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I first want to thank the anonymous referees who have taken on the daunting and very little rewarding task of reviewing this thesis.
I hope, and it was my intent, to have made this somewhat bearable --- who knows, interesting even?

José David
trust, freedom, guiding me through the .
I have always loathed the infantilising idea of working \emph{under the supervision} of someone, so I am grateful I could feel like I was working \emph{with} you to make original research happen.
3 years and a half is a long time, and ample time to at some point question what I have been doing, if it made sense, but now I feel at ease.
Marton for your warm welcome at the DNDS (along with all the other people of the department who made my stay more than enjoyable!).

I also wish to extend my thanks to all the support staff at the IFISC, whether for helping me navigate the administrative meanders of the UIB, in particular thanks to the --- sometimes intimidating  but in the end always helpful --- Marta, or for the technical help from the IT guys, in particular Rubén for having a solution to every problem, and Antònia, of course, for having done such a great job over so many years to build the huge database we have at the IFISC, without which most of the work presented here would not have been possible.
